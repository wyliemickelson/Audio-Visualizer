If the desired application is not listed, ensure that it is currently playing audio, and that volume is turned on.<br>
Then press "Refresh List" and it should appear.

After pressing "Ok" the visualization will appear

## Exiting the program
As the overlay is transparent and borderless, the application cannot simply be closed by the standard method.
There are two straightforward options to close it.

The easiest way to exit is to press and hold alt+tab and then hover over the top right corner of the application titled "Audio Visualizer" and click on the X that will then appear.

The other method is to navigate to the tray icons in the bottom right corner of the taskbar, right click the icon with the radar symbol and then click "Exit"<br>

If you cannot find the icon, try clicking the "^" symbol which should reveal all hidden tray icons.

## Preventing audio playback:
If you wish to visualize audio on an application, but do not want the audio to actually be played through your headphones/speakers,
you can change the audio playback device in most applications. If that is not supported by your application, navigate to "Sound Mixer Options," 
then for the application you wish to silence, change the output device from "Default" to a different option.
